# agents.md — free-ai

## Purpose
OpenAI-compatible API gateway on Cloudflare Workers — routes requests across 30+ free LLM providers with health-aware model selection, capability filtering, per-IP rate limiting, and aggregate analytics.

## Stack
- Framework: Hono + CF Workers (`@hono/zod-openapi` for typed routes + Swagger UI at `/docs`)
- Language: TypeScript (strict, ESM, ES2022)
- DB: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) — anonymous aggregate analytics (`GATEWAY_DB`)
- Auth: None on chat/embedding endpoints; `GATEWAY_API_KEY` Bearer required for `/v1/analytics` — NOT yet enforced (known gap)
- Testing: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e mock + live smoke)
- Deploy: Cloudflare Workers via `wrangler deploy`
- Package manager: pnpm

pnpm dev:local            # sync env vars + wrangler dev --local
pnpm deploy               # wrangler deploy (production)
pnpm test                 # vitest run
pnpm test:watch           # vitest watch
pnpm test:e2e             # playwright (mock e2e)
pnpm test:e2e:live        # playwright against live gateway
pnpm typecheck            # tsc --noEmit
pnpm check                # typecheck + unit tests
pnpm build                # build playground Vite SPA
node scripts/sync-dev-vars.mjs  # sync .env to wrangler dev vars
```

## Architecture notes
- **Request flow**: IP rate limit → parse/validate (Zod) → build model registry from available API keys → fetch health snapshots from `HealthStateDO` → `selectCandidates()` scores + ranks → retry loop (`p-retry`) calling provider → return OpenAI-format response with `x_gateway` metadata.
- **Scoring formula**: `successRate×0.6 + headroom×0.2 + latencyScore×0.15 + reasoningFit×0.05 + priority×0.02`. Failed models cooled down and excluded.
- **Capability filtering**: requests with `tools` → tool-capable models only; `response_format: json_object` → JSON-mode only; image content → vision-capable only. Returns 503 if no capable model available.
- **Known gaps**: (1) Analytics endpoint (`/v1/analytics`) is intentionally public by design (see code comment in handler) — not a bug. (2) `model=auto` vision routing: **verified working** (2026-04-25) — image payloads correctly route to vision-capable models via `deriveRequiredCapabilities` + `supportsVisionInput` in `select-model.ts`.
- **tsconfig**: was broken (no `include`, no workers types, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` conflict) — fixed 2026-04-25. Now typechecks clean with `@cloudflare/workers-types`, `e2e-live` excluded (it needs `@types/node` which isn't installed and runs locally only).
- **State**: single global `HealthStateDO`; per-IP `IpRateLimitDO`. KV (`HEALTH_KV`) for fast health snapshots.
- **Providers requiring API keys**: OpenRouter, Cerebras, SambaNova, NVIDIA, Groq, Gemini, Voyage. Workers AI uses CF AI binding (no extra key).
- **30+ chat models + 6 embedding models** in config registry.
- **Monolithic `index.ts`** (~55KB) — splitting is a known TODO.
- `site/` is an Astro site with its own `package.json`; managed separately.
- Playground Vite SPA served via `ASSETS` binding in `wrangler.toml`.
